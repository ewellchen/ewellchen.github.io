I am Yiwei Chen, a fifth-year PhD student at Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, advised by Prof. Yu Pan. 

I am currently working on computational imaging algorithms, especially their applications to single-photon imaging, including:
- Photon-efficient imaging
- Non-line-of-sight imaging
- Single-photon image super-resolution

I am also intreseted in quantum machine learning, including quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms, deep learning for quantum information and deep learning on quantum devices.
